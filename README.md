## Introduction
The Beta Calculator is a Python script that calculates the beta coefficient of a given stock in relation to a benchmark index. Beta is a measure of a stock's sensitivity to changes in the market, indicating how much the stock's price tends to move in response to fluctuations in the benchmark index.

## What is Beta Calculator?
The Beta Calculator is a powerful tool that utilizes linear regression to calculate the beta coefficient of a stock. Beta measures the stock's systematic risk, helping investors assess the stock's volatility and potential for gain or loss in relation to the overall market.

## Installation
To use the Beta Calculator, you will need Python and the required libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install necessary libraries: Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries and the `calculate_beta` function into your Python script.

2. Obtain historical stock price data for the specific stock and a benchmark index (e.g., Nifty) using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) or any other data source.

3. Prepare the data by calculating the daily returns for both the stock and the benchmark index.

4. Pass the stock data and the benchmark index data to the `calculate_beta` function.

5. The function will fit a linear regression model to the data, calculate the beta coefficient (slope), and add the beta column to the DataFrame.

6. The resulting DataFrame will contain the beta coefficient for the stock, indicating its sensitivity to the benchmark index.

## Configuration
No special configuration is required for this project.
